# Swing Trading Algorithm - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
The Swing Trading Algorithm is a software system designed to identify and simulate potentially profitable swing trades in the stock market over periods typically lasting from a few hours to several days. The system analyzes market data, makes objective decisions based on predefined rules, manages simulated risk, and learns from performance to improve effectiveness.

## Core Objectives
1. **Market Analysis**: Gather and analyze market data to identify potential trading opportunities
2. **Trading Decisions**: Generate entry and exit signals based on predefined rules
3. **Risk Management**: Calculate and manage risk for each trade
4. **Performance Tracking**: Record and analyze trading performance
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from past trades to improve future performance

- **4.3** Execute simulated exits based on stop-loss, profit targets, or signal changes
- **4.4** Calculate and record trade outcomes (profit/loss)
- **4.5** Update simulated account balance

### 5. Performance Analysis
- **5.1** Record detailed logs of all simulated trades
- **5.2** Calculate performance metrics (win rate, average profit/loss, drawdown)
- **5.3** Visualize performance over time
- **5.4** Identify strengths and weaknesses in the trading strategy
- **5.5** Generate periodic performance reports

### 6. Strategy Optimization
- **6.1** Backtest strategy variations on historical data
- **6.2** Optimize parameters based on performance metrics
- **6.3** Validate optimizations on out-of-sample data
- **6.4** Implement machine learning models to classify high-probability setups
- **6.5** Provide recommendations for strategy improvements

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance

- **3.2** Generate easy-to-understand performance reports
- **3.3** Allow configuration of trading parameters without code changes
- **3.4** Provide visualization of trades and performance metrics

### 4. Extensibility
- **4.1** Design modular architecture to allow easy addition of new indicators
- **4.2** Support multiple trading strategies
- **4.3** Allow for integration with external data sources
- **4.4** Support future integration with actual trading platforms
