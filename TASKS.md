## Task Assignment and Tracking

Each task should be tracked with the following information:
- Task ID and name
- Description
- Priority (High, Medium, Low)
- Status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked)
- Assigned to
- Estimated hours
- Actual hours
- Dependencies
- Notes

## Daily Workflow
1. Morning review of tasks and priorities
2. Update task statuses and notes
3. Implement planned features
4. Run tests to verify functionality
5. Document completed work
6. End-of-day review and planning for next day

## Weekly Review
At the end of each week:
1. Review completed tasks against plan
2. Adjust timeline if necessary
3. Identify and address blockers
4. Update documentation
5. Plan detailed tasks for the next week
6. Review and refine overall project plan

## Risk Management
- Identify potential risks early
- Document workarounds for known issues
- Maintain backup of all code and data
- Regularly test all components
